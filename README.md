This repo has my solutions to the assignments of UMC 202. The assignment pdfs are given in the corresponding folder. 

### Naming Scheme:
Any assignment solution has name `as-<assignment_number>(<question_number>).py`. For example, `as-1(1).py` is the solution to the first question of the first assignment. Lab test solutions are named accordingly. 

### USEFUL FILES:
- File `demethods.py` contain differential equation solving methods.
(TODO: Add names of functions and their descriptions)
- File `Gaussian.py` contain Gauss quadrature method. I could not do it in a good way.
(TODO: Do it in a good way)
- File `num_methods.py` contains all other numerical method functions.
